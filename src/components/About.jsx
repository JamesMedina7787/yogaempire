       Ive always been fascinated with the art of body and movement thatâ€™s motivated me,
	   in one shape or form, to be active my entire life. When I took my first yoga class,
	   I realized an immediate connection. After training 5 to 6 days a week in many styles
	   of yoga (Hatha, Ashtanga,etc.), my love for yoga was solidified when I decided I 
	   wanted to teach. Educated by the best yoga teachers in NYC, I am certified in
	   Vinyasa Flow Yoga which, short, means the flow of postures linked by the breath. 
	   I have worked with Yogis of all levels throughout, NYC, Westchester County, 
	   Long Island NY and Upstate NY. I have an immense appreciation for yoga and sharing 
	   it is my passion. So whether you want to begin or continue, elevate your fitness
	   level, both mind and body, by incorporating yoga in your daily routine. 
	   Its always an amazing time, come flow with Gia and we'll journey together.
      </p>
	  <p>
	  Join us for a variety of yoga classes, workshops, and personalized training sessions that elevate
	  your fitness journey. Together, well embark on a path of self discovery, balance, and harmony.
	  Its more than a practice. Its a lifestyle.
