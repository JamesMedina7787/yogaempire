        <p>We are a small Yoga community located in central New York. We been in business over ten years.

We are creative. We teach very loosely and uninihibited. You won't see us doing the same class twice.

You are the director of your own experience. When you practice with us, you get a personalized, therapeutic session specifically designed for you.

We are two certified Yoga instructors, that have both taught for about 8 years, throughout NYC, Westchester County, Long Island, and currently Central NY. We met in the Yoga arena. We have been working together ever since.
