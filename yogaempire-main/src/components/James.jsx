        My name is James. I am a 500-hour certified Yoga Instructor. My focus is on 
        strength and alignment, tailored into a path toward moving intelligently 
        towards our aspirations. Above all else, my classes are always fun and 
        inspiring. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re working on foundational poses or exploring more advanced asanas, 
        there’s a place for everyone in my class. Together, we’ll build a practice that 
        is different and special every time. Above all else, we will have fun, and I 
        look forward to meeting with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join me, James, as we progress together and embrace the joy of movement.
